# The-2022-Java-Programmer-RoadMap
One of the requests I received from many of my readers was for creating a Java Developer Roadmap. Since Java is my expertise, It wasn’t a problem to create a Java Developer Roadmap, but it took slightly longer for me to create one because of the limited time I get.

Anyway, I am finally ready to share my Java developer RoadMap with you. This Roadmap contains my years of experience and the unobstructed path of how to become a Java expert.
